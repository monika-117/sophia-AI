# Sophia AI Assistant
Sophia is a desktop AI assistant built using Python that can perform various tasks such as answering questions like ChatGPT, opening desktop applications, browsing websites, and even making phone and WhatsApp calls. This project is designed to be versatile and extensible, with the ability to add more functionalities easily. It integrates the Hugging Face API, a free ChatGPT alternative to simulate conversation, and offers multiple activation methods for user commands.

## Demo


## Schemantic Structure 

## Features

* **Voice Activation:** Activate Sophia by saying "Sophia."
* **Text Input:** Type your queries and press enter to receive a response.
* **App Control:** Open applications like Notepad and OneNote.
* **Website Navigation:** Open websites like YouTube and Canva.
* **Multimedia Control:** Search and play specific videos on YouTube.
* **Phone and WhatsApp Communication:** Make calls or send messages.

## Enabling Chat Responses (ChatGPT-like)

This assistant can answer questions in a conversational way using the Hugging Face Inference API. To enable full ChatGPT-like responses:

1. Get a Hugging Face API token from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens and set it in your environment:

   - Windows PowerShell:

     ```powershell
     $env:HF_API_TOKEN = "hf_xxx"
     ```

   - Or permanently via System Environment Variables.

2. (Optional) Choose a model by setting `HF_MODEL` environment variable (default: `google/flan-t5-large`).

3. Restart the app. Typed questions or voice queries that are not recognized as commands will be sent to the Hugging Face Inference API and Sophia will speak and display the response.

If no token is provided, the assistant will show a message explaining how to enable chat responses.
